## Individual retirement account (IRA)

- Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are personal retirement savings accounts that offer tax benefits and a range of investment options. Many investors use IRAs as their common source of saving for retirement.
- Even those with access to employer-sponsored plans, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), still tap into IRA tax advantages to boost their savings and add flexibility to their portfolio. 
- Most commonly chosen individual retirement options compared ([link](https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-vs-traditional-ira)):
  - Traditional IRA
    - With a Traditional IRA, you contribute pre-tax dollars,your money grows tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as current income after age 59½.
    - **Best suited for:** an individual who expects to be in the same or lower tax bracket when he or she starts taking withdrawals
    - **2023 contribution limit:** $6,500
    - **Contributions are tax deductible**
    - **Income limit:** None
  - Roth IRA
    - With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars, your money grows tax-free, and you can generally make tax- and penalty-free withdrawals after age 59½
    - **Best suited for:** an individual who expects to be in a higher tax bracket when he or she starts taking withdrawals
    - **2023 contribution limit:** $6,500
    - **Contributions are tax NOT deductible**
    - **Income limit:** "to contribute to a Roth IRA, single tax filers must have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of less than $153,000 in 2023. In 2024, the threshold rises to $161,000"
  - Rollover IRA
    - One way to take control of your retirement savings is to roll over your prior retirement plan from a former employer.
    - It is a process that allows you to move funds from your previous employer-sponsored retirement plan, a 401(k), for example, into an IRA. When you roll over your old retirement account into an IRA, you can preserve the tax-deferred status of your retirement assets without paying current taxes or early withdrawal penalties at the time of transfer. 

## Mutual Fund

- "Mutual funds let you pool your money with other investors to "mutually" buy stocks, bonds, and other investments. They're run by professional money managers who decide which securities to buy (stocks, bonds, etc.) and when to sell them. You get exposure to all the investments in the fund and any income they generate."
- "Buying mutual funds can be straightforward. Many banks and brokerage firms, including Schwab, have their own line of proprietary mutual funds as well as access to thousands of third-party funds."
- "You get the benefit of having a professional manager reviewing and researching the fund's portfolio on an ongoing basis."

### Types of mutual funds

- Equity funds
  - These funds invest in U.S. or foreign stocks. Some are index funds, while others are actively managed. Typically, they're defined by the size of the companies they invest in ("small-cap," "mid-cap," or "large-cap") or their investment objective ("growth," "income," etc.).
- Target date funds
  - A type of asset allocation fund where the mix of securities and asset classes—equities and fixed income for example—gradually shift as your target date for needing the money (usually for retirement) draws near.
- Asset allocation funds
  - These funds will allocate a specific amount to fixed income and equities depending on the fund's goal. They typically offer income and growth potential in one fund.
- Index funds
  - These funds comprise a portfolio of securities that attempt to mimic the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500® index. They offer a low-cost, straightforward way to track an index that's generally more tax efficient than actively managed funds.
- Money market funds
  - These funds generally invest in cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills and CDs. They're lower-risk investments and tend to offer better returns than savings accounts, but they are not insured by the FDIC.
- Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds
  - These funds consider noneconomic principles in their selection and weighting of securities, such as environmental responsibility, human rights, or religious views. Can also include funds that avoid investing in certain industries, such as defense, alcohol, tobacco, or gambling.
- Commodity funds
  - These funds invest in companies involved in commodity-intensive industries such as energy exploration and mining. While these funds can be a great hedge against inflation, they can also be more volatile than most stock funds.

## ETFs

- "Exchange-traded funds"
- Very similar to mutual funds, except for differences I don't really care about
- Likely just stick with mutual funds unless you want to become a finance bro

## Rate of Return

- This is normally reported as an **annual** (per year) rate

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- Vanguard uses this to report `rate of return`
- [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/37yknr/how_does_vanguard_calculate_rate_of_return/)
- Here's a brief intro to what IRR calculation actually does. Suppose you start on 1/1/2013 with a balance of A, then on 1/1/2014 you add B, then on 1/1/2015 you add C, and finally on 1/1/2016 your balance is D. If this were a bank account yielding a constant rate of interest, you could calculate D if you know the interest rate r. The original balance A grows to A(1 + r)^3, because it has 3 years to grow. The addition of B grows to B(1 + r)^2, since it only has 2 years to grow. The addition of C grows to C(1 + r), since it only has 1 year to grow.

```
A(1 + r)^3 + B(1 + r)^2 + C(1 + r)^1 = D
```

# Choosing Investments 

## Vanguard Funds

- [7 Best Vanguard Funds for Retirement](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/best-vanguard-funds-for-retirement)
- Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares Mutual Fund (`VTWAX`)
  - Young workers just beginning to invest for retirement can consider optimizing their portfolio for maximum growth via an all-equity mutual fund. By investing in a portfolio of 100% stocks, these investors can target greater long-term expected returns, as long as they can stomach the volatility. For a highly diversified all-equity mutual fund, consider VTWAX, which tracks the FTSE Global All Cap Index.
  - Buying shares of VTWAX is akin to purchasing small slices of the entire world's investable stock market, represented by more than 9,700 companies in its underlying index. This includes a 61% allocation to U.S. stocks, as well as developed countries like Japan and France, and emerging markets like China and India. The fund charges a 0.1% expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum investment.
- Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Mutual Fund (`VSVNX`)
  - Investors who buy a fund like VTWAX may eventually have to add bonds and cash over time to reduce volatility. To automate this approach, consider outsourcing the work to a target-date fund like VSVNX, which offers a pre-built portfolio of stocks and bonds that adjusts to become more conservative and less risky as its target retirement date of 2070 draws near. VSVNX charges a 0.08% expense ratio and requires a $1,000 minimum investment.
  - "Retirement savers who hold target-date funds in their retirement plans benefit from continuous rebalancing, broad diversification, low costs and are less likely to trade than do-it-yourself investors," Gandhi says. "According to Vanguard's 401(k) research, in 2022 only 2% of pure target-date fund investors made an exchange, a rate five times lower than that of other investors."
- Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Admiral Shares Mutual Fund (`VBIAX`)
  - With its inception dating back to November 2000, VBIAX is a mainstay in Vanguard's lineup. This fund adheres to the classic "60/40" strategy: a straightforward approach that involves allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds. Historically, this blend has been lauded for striking a balance between risk and return, providing investors with growth potential from stocks while having the relative stability of bonds.
- Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF (`VOO`)
